The first project I am sharing here started because I wanted to get more experienced with processing satellite data. The project is a Python project, that uses Open StreetMap data to generate training data for a model that finds basketball courts in satellite imagery. 

You can follow the progress [here](https://github.com/bartzwemmer/bball-court-finder).
